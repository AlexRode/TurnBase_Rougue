# First Game Project

This repository contains my very first game, which I developed as a project for my Object-Oriented Programming class. 

## Description

The game is a simple implementation of a classic genre and was created as a learning experience. It's important to note that there are a few bugs present. The intention was to understand the concepts of object-oriented design and to apply them in a practical context.
